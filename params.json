{"name":"Train","body":"# Introduction\r\nTrain is a logical game similar to old game snake. The tricky part is that\r\nthere is usually only one way out of the labyrinth full of items the train\r\nhas to take with it.\r\n\r\nIdea and game originally developed by Golem in assembler for MS-DOS. You can \r\ndownload original game [here](http://www.bestoldgames.net/eng/old-games/vlak.php).\r\n\r\n# Technologies\r\n* frontend - javascript, html, css. \r\n* backend - TBA\r\n\r\n# Design\r\nThe aim is to create loosely coupled and object oriented design using javascript.\r\nIdeally each component is easily replaceable by another.\r\nThis allows us to implement for example multiple views: one that is using div+css,\r\nanother that is using html5 canvas, etc.\r\n\r\n**Frontend** part runs completely in the browser. As we are quite flexible with html\r\nin browser, one could design bunch of specific levels, not just standard rectangle\r\ntype (e.g. wide screen full HD level). Html ensures that game is playable on all \r\ncurrent and future platforms like pc, mobile, television, consoles, etc.\r\n\r\n**Backend** part is TBD, but we want to support both standalone and remove versions.\r\nStandalone means all levels are loaded in the beginning to the browser and no\r\ninternet connection is required. Remote means the levels are loaded from the server.\r\nThis can be specific host or a cloud. Remove would allow to play custom levels\r\ncreated by community.\r\n\r\n# Dependencies\r\nAll components except current view are written in _POJO_- plain old javascript.\r\nCurrent view engine depends on jQuery and it's DOM and CSS manipulations. As discussed\r\nbefore, this can be easily replaceable with another view engine.\r\n\r\n# Implementation\r\nTo avoid dependencies and heavy external libraries, many core components are implemented\r\nusing plain old javascript:\r\n- binding and event handling with correct context of the event handler (clock, keyboard).\r\n- clock\r\n- classes and inheritance. We developed simple helper function that sets up the inheritance.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nBrowsers included in testing: FF, IE, Chrome\r\n\r\n# Extensions\r\nPlan is to provide level editor to allow community to create new levels.\r\nIt should be also possible to easily create new graphics for a view engine and\r\nconfigure it to be used.\r\n\r\n# Learning\r\nThe project is relatively simple and one can benefit from studying source codes.\r\nAlmost all core components are written in plain javascript including class inheritance\r\nand event handling with correct context.\r\nSource codes are well documented. Aim is also given on KISS rule and self explaining\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Train is a logical game written in javascript, html, css","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
