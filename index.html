        <h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Train is a logical game similar to old game snake. The tricky part is that
there is usually only one way out of the labyrinth full of items the train
has to take with it.</p>

<p>Idea and game originally developed by Golem in assembler for MS-DOS. You can 
download original game <a href="http://www.bestoldgames.net/eng/old-games/vlak.php">here</a>.</p>

<h1>Technologies</h1>

<ul>
<li>frontend - javascript, html, css. </li>
<li>backend - TBA</li>
</ul><h1>Design</h1>

<p>The aim is to create loosely coupled and object oriented design using javascript.
Ideally each component is easily replaceable by another.
This allows us to implement for example multiple views: one that is using div+css,
another that is using html5 canvas, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Frontend</strong> part runs completely in the browser. As we are quite flexible with html
in browser, one could design bunch of specific levels, not just standard rectangle
type (e.g. wide screen full HD level). Html ensures that game is playable on all 
current and future platforms like pc, mobile, television, consoles, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Backend</strong> part is TBD, but we want to support both standalone and remove versions.
Standalone means all levels are loaded in the beginning to the browser and no
internet connection is required. Remote means the levels are loaded from the server.
This can be specific host or a cloud. Remove would allow to play custom levels
created by community.</p>

<h1>Dependencies</h1>

<p>All components except current view are written in <em>POJO</em>- plain old javascript.
Current view engine depends on jQuery and it's DOM and CSS manipulations. As discussed
before, this can be easily replaceable with another view engine.</p>

<h1>Implementation</h1>

<p>To avoid dependencies and heavy external libraries, many core components are implemented
using plain old javascript:
- binding and event handling with correct context of the event handler (clock, keyboard).
- clock
- classes and inheritance. We developed simple helper function that sets up the inheritance.</p>

<h1>Testing</h1>

<p>Browsers included in testing: FF, IE, Chrome</p>

<h1>Extensions</h1>

<p>Plan is to provide level editor to allow community to create new levels.
It should be also possible to easily create new graphics for a view engine and
configure it to be used.</p>

<h1>Learning</h1>

<p>The project is relatively simple and one can benefit from studying source codes.
Almost all core components are written in plain javascript including class inheritance
and event handling with correct context.
Source codes are well documented. Aim is also given on KISS rule and self explaining
names.</p>
